# CONTRIBUTING

Contributions are welcome, both from players and developers.

## As a Player

As a player, you can contribute by simply using the patch and reporting unlisted bugs.
Please refrain from suggesting features, as the current focus is only on implementing rollback network code.

## As a Developer

As a developer, you can contribute by figuring things through reverse engineering and coding features listed in the Kanban board (https://github.com/fictionalist/RED-VOID/projects/1).
